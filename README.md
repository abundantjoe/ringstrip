# ringstrip: one continuous strip from many grown patches

Ink models run on small grown patches. Readers need one sheet. `ringstrip` puts every pixel of every patch's map back where it belongs on the unrolled winding, by azimuth and height, and gives you one continuous image per direction; it also stitches overlapping tiles of a flat grid with feathered seams.

## Quick start (1 minute)
```bash
pip install -e . && pytest            # 2 synthetic tests
bash scripts/reproduce.sh              # rebuilds the PHerc0268 strip from the 5 included patches (tifxyz + maps)
python -m ringstrip.unroll out/strip.png <axis_x> <axis_y> <R_ref> map.png my_patches/i*
```

## What it does
- `python -m ringstrip.unroll <out.png> <axis_x> <axis_y> <R_ref> <map_name> <patch_dir>...`
  Each patch directory holds `tifxyz/` (x, y, z .tif) and a map rendered on it (same aspect). Every map pixel gets its 3-D position by bilinear interpolation of the tifxyz, then lands at (azimuth × R_ref, z). Overlaps are averaged, 1-3 px holes closed, and a JSON records the cut azimuth, offsets and coverage. Patches from different grows, even different sessions, merge into the same strip.
- `python -m ringstrip.stitch tiles.json out.png`: reassembles overlapping tiles of one grid (20 px per cell by default) with feathered overlaps.

## Validation
- `test_two_adjacent_patches_unroll_into_one_continuous_line`: two synthetic cylinder patches overlapping in azimuth, each carrying one bright line at the same height, unroll into a strip where that line is continuous across the seam (> 90 % of its length bright).
- `test_stitch_reproduces_a_gradient_from_overlapping_tiles`: three overlapping tiles of a gradient reassemble to within 2 grey levels everywhere.
- Real data: `results/PHerc0268_band070_ink9um_forward_strip.png` is five 2 × 2 cm patches of PHerc0268 (band r/R = 0.70, mid-height) unrolled into one 10,513 × 2,507 px strip (the ink map on it is uniform speckle; the surfaces, not the tool, are the problem there, see the `xsec` package).

## Known limits
- Assumes one winding: azimuth is measured about a single axis point; a patch that spans two windings will overlap itself.
- The strip is not an isometric flattening; it is a readable layout for maps that were already rendered on each patch.

## Install and test
`pip install -e .` then `pytest` (2 tests, about 3 s). The five patches used for the figure are included under `results/PHerc0268_band070/` (tifxyz + half-resolution maps).
